Country,Simple Paragraph 1,Simple Paragraph 2,Country Profile Text
Australia,none,none,"<p>In November 2017, Australia’s <a href=""https://www.fpwhitepaper.gov.au/foreign-policy-white-"">foreign policy white paper</a> characterised the country’s aid strategy as ‘focused on the Indo-Pacific and promot[ing] the national interest by contributing to sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction’. Australia continues to apply four tests as it allocates aid, the first of which is whether providing aid is in Australia’s national interest. (The other three focus on inclusive growth, added value and value for money.)</p>
<p>In May 2020, Australia released a <a href=""https://donortracker.org/country/australia"">new report</a> on its development response to Covid-19, indicating that its development strategy will be diverted to focus on the pandemic’s effects in the Indo-Pacific region. The report notes that, ‘while this pandemic is global, our interests, influence and capabilities are concentrated in our immediate neighbourhood’.</p>
<p>Australia ranks 14th on the Principled Aid Index, unchanged from last year. Its best performance is on the public spiritedness dimension, where it is 6th due to a comparatively high share of spending in recipient countries, as well as aid levels that are largely unaffected by shifting political dynamics in recipient states.</p>
<p>By contrast, it ranks just 21st on the development gaps dimension, largely because of its regional focus. Recipients in the Pacific region tend to have few displaced persons, lower levels of conflict, less extreme poverty and a greater ability to self-finance, compared to other recipient countries. As such, Australia has consistently ranked among the bottom third of donors on this dimension due to below-average performance in these three areas. By contrast, Australia scores well on gender-related development gaps, ranking first among donors on spending on gender-related projects.</p>
<p>Australia ranks 10th on the global cooperation dimension, having risen eight ranks since 2013. This is largely driven by an increase in ODA allocated to aid-for-trade activities, which have become a <a href=""https://www.dfat.gov.au/aid/topics/development-issues/aid-for-trade/Pages/aid-for-trade"">central tenet</a> of Australia’s international development policy.</p>"
Austria,none,none,"<p>Austria’s <em><a href=""https://www.bmeia.gv.at/fileadmin/user_upload/Zentrale/Aussenpolitik/Entwicklungszusammenarbeit/Dreijahresprogramm_der_oesterreichischen_Entwicklungspolitik_englisch.pdf"">Three-Year Programme on Austrian Development Policy 2019–2021</a></em> lists as one of its guiding principles ‘advancing Austrian interests and putting its core competencies to use … our development policy … aims at improving the welfare of people locally, while also advancing Austrian interests worldwide’. To this end, the country claims to focus on ‘developing the poorest countries [as well as] crisis regions and fragile states’. Another guiding principle is a commitment to ‘strengthening efficient and effective multilateralism’.</p>
<p>Austria’s <a href=""https://www.entwicklung.at/en/ada/news/detail-en/coronavirus-austria-supports-strategic-preparedness-and-response-plan-of-who"">international development response to Covid-19</a> has echoed these priorities, with an increase in spending on crisis regions and fragile states, coupled with support for multilateral Covid-19 funds.</p>
<p>Austria ranks 23rd on the Principled Aid Index, placing in the bottom third of donors on all three dimensions. Its top performance is in the global cooperation dimension, where it is ranked 19th. Austria scores particularly well on providing core funding for the multilateral system.</p>
<p>Austria ranks 22nd in the development gaps dimension, although it scores well on support for displaced populations, where it is 6th. It scores particularly poorly on targeting aid towards recipients with the highest poverty rates and the most severely financially challenged countries, ranking 24th on both indicators.</p>
<p>Austria ranks 22nd on the public spiritedness dimension, with low scores across this dimension apart from a mid-table rank on the use of aid to influence elections. 
</p>"
Belgium,none,none,"<p>In 2017, Belgium introduced a <a href=""https://diplomatie.belgium.be/sites/default/files/downloads/comprehensive_approach_en.pdf"">new foreign policy strategy</a> that sought greater coherence between development and diplomatic aims, to protect the country’s ‘interests and values’. In a subsequent <a href=""https://diplomatie.belgium.be/sites/default/files/downloads/beleidsnota_oktober_2017.pdf"">2018 policy note</a>, Belgium committed to focus on ‘least advanced countries and fragile states in Africa’ in its development efforts.</p>
<p>Belgium has continued this approach in its <a href=""https://www.enabel.be/content/enabel-taking-action-against-covid-19"">response to Covid-19</a>, focusing its efforts on the poorest African countries. However, it has not published an update to its international development strategy in light of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Belgium ranks 8th on the Principled Aid Index, three places higher than the previous year. Belgium scores particularly well on the public spiritedness dimension, ranking 4th. This is driven by its performance on the tied aid measure, and the independence of aid spending from UN voting patterns.</p>
<p>Belgium also scores well on the development gaps dimension, reflecting its policy of concentrating on poor and fragile countries. It scores especially well on targeting social protection spending to the most financially challenged recipients.</p>
<p>Belgium’s overall score is pulled down by a below-average performance on the global cooperation dimension, where it is ranked 17th, scoring below average in four out of five indicators in this dimension.</p>"
Canada,none,none,"<p>Canada’s 2018 <a href=""https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/development/oecd-development-co-operation-peer-reviews-canada-2018_9789264303560-en#page20"">Development Assistance Committee peer review</a> commented that ‘Canadian values and national interests underpin its efforts to shape global processes positively’. In 2017, Canada released its <a href=""https://international.gc.ca/world-monde/issues_development-enjeux_developpement/priorities-priorites/policy-politique.aspx?lang=eng#4"">Feminist International Assistance Policy</a> with the primary objective of addressing inequality among women and girls and advocating for a rights-based approach to gender. These priorities continue to frame its development assistance.</p>
<p>Canada’s international <a href=""https://donortracker.org/country/canada"">response to Covid-19</a> has reflected its pre-existing development priorities, highlighting the need to support vulnerable populations, including women and those in extreme poverty. It has also re-emphasised its commitment to multilateralism, both via financial commitments through international organisations and non-financial actions.</p>
<p>Canada maintained 4th place in the PA Index for the fourth year running, after a large increase from 16th to 4th over 2014–2015. Canada scores particularly well on the global cooperation dimension, where it has ranked first or second every year since 2015, demonstrating its strong commitment to multilateralism. Canada’s score on this dimension is driven by the high proportion of ODA it provides for <a href=""https://international.gc.ca/gac-amc/assets/pdfs/publications/odaaa-16-17-eng.pdf"">climate action and controlling the spread of infectious diseases</a>.</p>
<p>Canada also scores well on the development gaps dimension, coming 3rd, with particularly high shares of ODA dedicated to assisting conflict-affected states and funding social safety nets in financially challenged countries. Canada’s feminist international policy is apparent, as its spending targeting gender inequality has seen it rise from 20th to 12th on this indicator since 2013. However, this indicator remains Canada’s lowest ranking within the development gaps dimension.</p>
<p>Canada’s overall ranking is brought down by its score on public spiritedness, where it was ranked 17th, with relatively low rankings in all five indicators in this dimension.</p>"
Czech Republic,none,none,"<p>In 2017, the Czech Republic released its <a href=""https://www.mzv.cz/file/2710363/CZ_Development_Cooperation_Strategy_2018_2030.pdf"">2018–2030 development cooperation strategy</a>, which defined development as ‘an expression of solidarity, a key instrument of foreign policy, and an investment into the country’s own security’. Its vision is to contribute to poverty reduction while promoting its national interests, including stronger political, trade and investment relations. According to the <a href=""https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/development/oecd-development-co-operation-peer-reviews-czech-republic-2016_9789264264939-en#page18"">Development Assistance Committee</a>, there are growing demands to use aid to address regional instability and the European refugee crisis. At the time of writing, the Czech Republic had not released an international development response to Covid-19.</p>
<p>The Czech Republic ranks 24th on the Principled Aid Index, the same as in 2017. Its best score is consistently in the development gaps dimension, where it comes 18th, driven by a high rank on its assistance to conflict-affected states (5th place).</p>
<p>The Czech Republic ranks 28th in the global cooperation dimension and 25th in the public spiritedness dimension. It is in the bottom third for every indicator within these two dimensions, with the exception of the indicator for the correlation between aid and arms exports (within the public spiritedness dimension), where it is 14th.  This result is not driven by a low level of arms exports; the Czech Republic is the fourth or fifth largest exporter of arms to ODA-eligible countries every year in our sample.</p>"
Denmark,none,none,"<p>In 2016, Denmark’s new <a href=""http://um.dk/en/foreign-policy/danish-defence-and-diplomacy-in-times-of-change/"">foreign and security policy review</a> positioned development as an integral pillar alongside defence, security and trade. Danish national interest was a ‘common reference point’ that was ‘meant to serve as continuous guidelines for prioritising foreign policy initiatives by helping … distinguish between the need-to-do, important-to-do and nice-to do issues’. Development cooperation is identified as a vehicle for Denmark to invest ‘in a world of progress and sustainable growth benefiting the developing countries as well as the Danish welfare state and Danish businesses’, with a strong focus on sustainable growth, fragile states and the ‘prevention of refugee and migration flows’. These priorities are mirrored in the Danish government’s new <a href=""https://um.dk/en/danida-en/Strategies%20and%20priorities/"">strategy for development cooperation and humanitarian action</a>, <em>The World 2030</em>, released in January 2017.</p>
<p>Denmark ranks 7th on the Principled Aid Index, a rise of six places since 2013. Denmark has, however, seen a sustained drop in public spiritedness over the last two years, falling three ranks on this dimension, to 8th place.</p>
<p>In the global cooperation dimension, Denmark is ranked 9th. This is driven by an increase in aid spent on fostering global peace and security. Denmark has risen from 13th on this indicator (2015) to 1st.</p>
<p>Denmark comes 11th on the development gaps dimension, scoring well in ODA spent assisting conflict-affected states and targeting gender inequality.</p>"
Finland,none,none,"<p>Finland’s <a href=""https://um.fi/documents/35732/0/Finlands+development+policy+2016.pdf/ebf6681d-6b17-5b27-ca88-28eae361a667?t=1561448337759"">development policy</a> emphasises the reciprocal nature of international development: ‘Development policy is important not only for those receiving support but also for Finland. In our era, countries and nations have unprecedented opportunities to achieve well-being and success. At the same time, their futures are more closely interlinked than perhaps ever before’. It aims to <a href=""https://um.fi/goals-and-principles-of-finland-s-development-policy"">support developing countries’ efforts to eradicate poverty</a> and inequality and promote sustainable development. Development policy is an ‘<a href=""https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/development/oecd-development-co-operation-peer-reviews-finland-2017_9789264287235-en#page27"">integral part of Finland’s foreign and security policy</a>, the overarching goal of which is to strengthen its international position, secure its independence and regional integrity, and improve the security and welfare of its people’. The country draws on Nordic values and underlying principles in its development programming, including <a href=""https://um.fi/goals-and-principles-of-finland-s-development-policy"">rights-based approaches</a>, and orients its investments towards <a href=""https://um.fi/documents/35732/48132/government_report_on_development_policy_2016__summary"">Least Developed Countries and fragile states</a>. Finland has not released an international development response to Covid-19.</p>
<p>Finland was one of the few countries to improve their raw score on the Principled Aid Index since 2017. However, its relative ranking was unchanged, remaining in 17th place overall. By contrast, Finland fell from 5th place to 17th over the period 2013 to 2017. Finland has particularly improved in providing core support to the multilateral system, where it moved up six ranks, to 3rd place.</p>
<p>Finland also improved by three ranks in the public spiritedness dimension, moving into 15th place. Finland’s best ranking, however, was in the development gaps dimension, where it came 9th. This is driven by top-10 positions in spending on gender inequality and targeting social safety net spending towards the most severely financially challenged countries.</p>"
France,none,none,"<p>In February 2018, France’s Interministerial Committee for International Cooperation and Development (CICID) <a href=""https://donortracker.org/country/france"">reaffirmed its commitment</a> to the protection of global public goods, the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Climate Agreement. To that end, France has particularly focused on <a href=""http://www.realityofaid.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/10-Will-Emmanuel-Macron-Make-French-Aid-Great-Again.pdf"">increasing the quantity of its aid</a>, with an aim to allocate 0.55% of French gross national income to official development assistance by 2022 (up from 0.43% in 2017) before eventually reaching 0.7%. CICID also outlined <a href=""https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/development/oecd-development-co-operation-peer-reviews-france-2018_9789264302679-en#page15"">five priority areas for French aid</a>: peace and stability, climate change, education, gender equality and global health.</p>
<p>A bill to enshrine this expansion of ODA into law has been delayed due to Covid-19. The French development agency has mobilised new grants and loans to help recipients cope with the effects of Covid. In this respect, France has continued its regional focus on countries in French-speaking Africa.</p>
<p>France ranks 19th on the Principled Aid Index, the same as the previous year. This makes it the lowest-ranked G7 country. France’s worst score was in the development gaps dimension, where it was ranked 24th. This was particularly driven by France’s low level of ODA to conflict-affected states. France has consistently been among the worst-performing donors on this indicator, but it has taken last place for the first time, with only 0.8% of ODA going to conflict-affected states. France’s ranking on supporting displaced populations has also declined, from 7th place (2013) to 17th. Both these trends are likely to reverse if France maintains its commitment to provide €500 million (around 4% of French aid) to conflict-affected and fragile states by 2022.</p>
<p>On the global cooperation dimension, France is in 14th place. France scores particularly well on the aid-for-trade indicator, where it is ranked 4th, but performs poorly on contributions to global peace and security, where it is ranked 27th.</p>
<p>France is also towards the middle of the pack on the public spiritedness dimension. Its ranking on this dimension has fallen seven places since 2013.</p>"
Germany,none,none,"<p>Germany frames its <a href=""https://www.bmz.de/en/publications/type_of_publication/strategies/Strategiepapier452_10_2018.PDF"">development policy</a> under an overarching narrative of cooperation and interdependence. The country is concerned by the <a href=""https://donortracker.org/country/germany"">interdependent nature of global flows</a> of people and focuses on ‘fighting the root causes of displacement’, including climate change, forced displacement and food security. Its <a href=""https://www.bmz.de/en/publications/type_of_publication/strategies/Strategiepapier354_04_2015.pdf"">approach to sustainable development</a> is ‘based on its values and guided by its interests’.</p>
<p>Germany has reinforced these themes in its <a href=""https://www.bmz.de/en/zentrales_downloadarchiv/Presse/bmz_corona_paket_EN.pdf"">development response to Covid-19</a>, with its Covid support policy (subtitled ‘We will either beat COVID-19 worldwide or not at all’) repeatedly reinforcing the message that Covid-19 can only be overcome via international cooperation: ‘It is in our own interest to fight the virus worldwide. Otherwise, it will return to us in Germany and Europe in waves. So our perspective must go beyond Germany and Europe’. This is a direct analogy with the approach that Germany has taken to forced displacement, believing that, if it does not solve the problem where it is, then it will come to Germany.</p>
<p>Germany ranks 15th on the PA Index, continuing the upward trend that began in 2017. However, Germany’s rank on the development gaps dimension has continued to fall. It is now placed 23rd, a fall of eight rankssince 2013. This is primarily driven by a drop in aid to displaced populations.</p>
<p>Germany scores far better on the global cooperation dimension, coming 8th overall. Except for providing core support for the multilateral system (where it ranks 25th), Germany scores well across this dimension. It stands out for strong scores on tackling the effects of climate change, where it has been ranked 1st for four years in a row.</p>
<p>Similarly, Germany comes 9th on the public spiritedness dimension. Like other Northern European donors, it has made significant progress on spending ODA in recipient countries. 
</p>"
Greece,none,none,"<p>The domestic effects of the European migration crisis have led Greece to <a href=""https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/9789264311893-en/1/2/1/index.html?itemId=/content/publication/9789264311893-en&_csp_=c084b24bc0897a08485a9b7217e72e6a&itemIGO=oecd&itemContentType=book"">focus its ODA on peace and stability</a> in its neighbourhood. The country has also affirmed its <a href=""https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/19378Greece_VNR_Greece_2018_pdf_FINAL_140618.pdf"">commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals</a>. However, Greece <a href=""https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/9789264311893-en/1/2/2/2/index.html?itemId=/content/publication/9789264311893-en&_csp_=c084b24bc0897a08485a9b7217e72e6a&itemIGO=oecd&itemContentType=book#chapter-d1e1917"">lacks a vision or statement of purpose</a> to guide its aid policy.</p>
<p>Greece has achieved the largest absolute increase in score on the Principled Aid Index across 2013–2018, increasing its raw score by more than seven points, a four-fold increase. Despite this, Greece has remained in 28th place in the overall index, over all six years, due to its starting score being much lower than donors ranked just above it. On the development gaps dimension, however, Greece has climbed a further five ranks after rising three in the previous year. This is driven by Greece’s assistance to conflict-affected states, where it has moved from last place (2015) to first. This predominantly comprises bilateral aid to Turkey, but also includes significant aid to Syria. Greece has also significantly increased its share of spending on supporting displaced populations and targeting gender inequality.</p>
<p>By contrast, Greece has fallen by six places on the public spiritedness dimension since 2017, from 20th to 26th. This is driven by a general decline across all five indicators in this dimension.</p>
<p>Greece also ranks poorly on the global cooperation dimension, coming last in every year.</p>"
Hungary,none,none,"<p>In 2019, Hungary adopted a new <a href=""https://nefe.kormany.hu/download/7/3f/92000/NEFE2025_summary_en.pdf"">international development cooperation strategy</a> covering the period 2020–2025. Hungary sees international development as an opportunity to ‘contribute effectively to the SDGs and promote Hungarian foreign policy and economic interests’. <a href=""https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/a80b014d-en/index.html?itemId=/content/component/a80b014d-en"">Priority areas</a> are: 1) establishing long-lasting, mutually beneficial economic partnerships; and 2) addressing the root causes of migration. Hungary has had a regional focus on Central and Eastern Europe, but aims to expand this to sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>Hungary has not published an update to its strategy in response to Covid-19, but has <a href=""https://reliefweb.int/report/world/covid-19-hungary-continuing-help-countries-need"">confirmed its commitment</a> to supporting regional partners.</p>
<p>Hungary ranks 27th on the Principled Aid Index, third from last. It acceded to the DAC in 2016, and took last place in the Index in that year and in 2017, so this marks its first ranking rise. Nonetheless, Hungary ranks in the bottom five donors on all three dimensions. Its best ranking is in the global cooperation dimension, where it is 24th. Hungary provides comparatively high levels of funding for climate change mitigation and adaptation, ranking 14th on this dimension. It has also increased its spending on communicable diseases, rising by seven ranks on this indicator since 2017, from 26th to 19th.</p>
<p>Hungary ranks 28th on the development gaps dimension, with low scores in all indicators, with the exception of spending on displaced populations, where it ranks 5th.</p>
<p>Hungary ranks 27th in the public spiritedness dimension, with low scores on all indicators in this dimension.</p>"
Iceland,none,none,"<p><a href=""https://www.government.is/library/01-Ministries/Ministry-for-Foreign-Affairs/Iceida/Publications/Parliamentary Resolution on Iceland%e2%80%99s policy for international development cooperation.pdf"">International development cooperation</a> is regarded as ‘one of the pillars of Iceland’s foreign policy and an important part of Iceland’s National Security Policy’. The updated <a href=""https://www.government.is/library/01-Ministries/Ministry-for-Foreign-Affairs/Iceida/Publications/Parliamentary Resolution on Iceland%e2%80%99s policy for international development cooperation.pdf"">Development Cooperation Act</a> (2015) abolished the Icelandic International Development Agency in order to bring multiple different parties (ministries, businesses and civil society) into foreign aid collaboration. In Icelands’s policy for international development cooperation 2019–2023, poverty, human rights, gender equality and peace and security are highlighted as key objectives, alongside specific activities (for example geothermal energy and fisheries) that draw on Iceland’s expertise in these areas.</p>
<p>Iceland has not released an update to its international development strategy in light of Covid-19, but has <a href=""https://www.government.is/news/article/2020/05/08/276-million-ISK-in-response-to-COVID-19-in-developing-countries/"">contributed towards multilateral efforts</a>.</p>
<p>Iceland ranks 12th on the Principled Aid Index. It came 2nd every year between 2013 and 2015, but since the abolition of the International Development Agency in 2015 its ranking has dropped 10 places. Despite this, Iceland continues to perform well on the development gaps dimension, coming 2nd. Iceland has never been outside of the top five donors on development gaps, reflecting its policy focus on poverty. It performs particularly well on targeting social protection spending towards the most severely financially challenged recipients.</p>
<p>Iceland scores poorly on the global cooperation dimension, coming 23rd. This is driven by low spending on climate change and communicable diseases. Iceland’s rank for spending on climate change has dropped from 3rd (2013) to 24th.</p>
<p>Iceland’s ranking in the public spiritedness dimension has also fallen, from 3rd (2017) to 10th. This is driven by an increase in Iceland’s level of tied aid. Iceland has fallen from 2nd on the tied aid indicator (2017) to 26th; 91% of Iceland’s aid was tied or partially tied in 2018, compared to none in previous years.</p>"

Ireland,none,none,"<p>In July 2018, the Irish government published a new <a href=""https://www.irishaid.ie/media/irishaid/aboutus/abetterworldirelandspolicyforinternationaldevelopment/A-Better-World-Irelands-Policy-for-International-Development.pdf"">policy for international development</a>, <em>A Better World</em>. The policy has a strong focus on supporting the multilateral system and those most in need. It identifies Ireland’s key areas of focus as: a) prioritising gender equality; b) reducing humanitarian need; c) climate action; and d) strengthening governance. This new policy forms part of Ireland’s broader foreign policy, <em>Global Ireland 2025</em>, which aims to double the scope and impact of the country’s global footprint in the period to 2025. Unlike most other donors that score well on the Principled Aid Index, Ireland provides low quantities of aid. However, <a href=""https://www.irishaid.ie/media/irishaid/aboutus/abetterworldirelandspolicyforinternationaldevelopment/A-Better-World-Irelands-Policy-for-International-Development.pdf"">aid levels have increased</a> since 2014, and there are plans to reach the 0.7% of GNI target by 2030.</p>
<p>Ireland has emphasised themes of global connectivity in its <a href=""https://www.dfa.ie/news-and-media/speeches/speeches-archive/2020/april/ireland-supports-international-covid-19-response.php"">international development response to Covid-19</a>, with the <a href=""https://www.irishaid.ie/news-publications/news/newsarchive/2020/july/colm-brophy-td-appointed-as-minister-for-overseas-development-aid-and-diaspora.html"">Minister for Overseas Development Aid and Diaspora</a> stressing that ‘Covid-19 reminds us of how our safety and development at home is linked to the safety and development of others abroad, and I want to work as Minister to ensure that Ireland plays a full role in the global response to the pandemic’. <a href=""https://www.dfa.ie/news-and-media/press-releases/press-release-archive/2020/august/irish-support-for-global-responses-to-covid-19-reaches-123-million.php"">Irish Aid has committed €123 million</a> to the international response to the pandemic as of August 2020, through bilateral and multilateral channels.</p>
<p>Ireland scores very well on the Principled Aid Index, coming first in every year. Even so, its raw score decreased by more than the average donor since 2017. This is mainly driven by a fall in its score on the public spiritedness dimension, where it declined on every indicator. However, Ireland still took first place on this dimension, with a particularly good score for spending in recipient countries.</p>
<p>Ireland also takes first place on the development gaps dimension. It comes in the top three donors for every indicator in this dimension, except for targeting gender inequality. On gender inequality, Ireland rose from 16th in 2013 to 1st in 2017, as this is a key <a href=""https://www.irishaid.ie/media/irishaid/aboutus/abetterworldirelandspolicyforinternationaldevelopment/A-Better-World-Irelands-Policy-for-International-Development.pdf"">priority area for Irish Aid</a>. However, Ireland’s rank on this indicator has now dropped back down to 7th.</p>
<p>Ireland’s high ranks in the development gaps and public spiritedness dimensions contrast with a relatively low ranking in global cooperation; Ireland is 15th on this dimension. This is driven by low scores on funding aid-for-trade and climate mitigation and adaptation. However, Ireland has improved by two ranks overall on this dimension. This improvement is driven by an increase in spending on global peace and security and core support for the multilateral system.</p>"
Italy,none,none,"<p>International cooperation is ‘<a href=""https://www.esteri.it/mae/it/cooperaz_sviluppo/la-riforma-della-cooperazione.html"">an integral and qualifying part of foreign policy</a>’ for Italy. In July 2020, the Italian Agency for Development Cooperation (AICS) released its <a href=""http://www.senato.it/service/PDF/PDFServer/BGT/01157152.pdf"">strategy for the three-year period 2019–2020</a>. This strategy is <a href=""https://donortracker.org/country/italy"">anchored in the SDGs</a> and mitigating the root causes of migration and displacement. Italy has not released a strategy for its international development in relation to Covid-19.</p>
<p>Italy ranks 18th on the Principled Aid Index, a rise of two places since 2017 and its best-ever position. Its highest score is in the public spiritedness dimension, where it ranks 12th. This score is driven by Italy having little tied aid, ranking 2nd on this indicator.</p>
<p>By contrast, Italy ranks 21st in the global cooperation dimension. It has low scores across this dimension, but ranks particularly badly on the indicator for aid-for-trade.</p>
<p>On the development gaps dimension Italy is in 15th place, a rise of five places since 2017. This is driven by an improvement in all indicators in this dimension, but Italy has particularly improved its spending on internationally displaced persons.</p>"
Japan,none,none,"<p>Japan’s development policy is founded in its <em><a href=""https://www.mofa.go.jp/files/000406629.pdf"">Development Cooperation Charter</a></em>, passed in 2015. The charter is ‘based on the principle of international cooperation’ and promotes ‘securing the national interests of Japan’ by using ODA ‘strategically and effectively as one of the most important foreign policy tools’. Japan <a href=""https://donortracker.org/country/japan"">prioritises self-reliant development</a>, the promotion of economic growth and public–private partnerships, using official development assistance to engage Japanese companies in emerging markets. Japan has historically focused on bilateral ODA, although its <a href=""https://www.mofa.go.jp/files/000259285.pdf"">contributions to multilaterals have increased</a>, and are set to grow further.</p>
<p>In its <a href=""https://www.jica.go.jp/COVID-19/en/responses/research/adtkbc00000005xc-att/JICA_COVID19.pdf"">international development response to Covid-19</a>, Japan has reiterated its emphasis on self-reliant development. The response of Japan’s International Cooperation Agency recognises ‘the ownership that each country is demonstrating in its own way’. It aims to meet the urgent needs of low- and middle-income countries, promote universal healthcare and establish a ‘new world’ that confronts the challenges of modern society.</p>
<p>Japan ranks 9th on the Principled Aid Index, its highest-ever position. It scores well on the global cooperation dimension, ranking 7th across all donors, having risen eight places since 2013. This score is driven by the high share of ODA that it allocates to trade facilitation, a key priority for Japanese aid.</p>
<p>Japan also scores fairly well on the public spiritedness dimension, coming 11th. This is driven by a strong performance on spending aid in recipient countries, but is also hampered by a strong correlation between aid disbursements and beneficiaries agreeing with Japan’s position in UN votes.</p>
<p>Japan scores less well on the development gaps dimension, coming 19th. Its ranking on the development gaps dimension has fallen by six places since 2013. This is partially driven by a poor record on assisting conflict-affected states, as well as declining performance on targeting social safety net spending to the most severely financially challenged recipients.</p>"
Korea,none,none,"<p>The Republic of Korea identifies poverty reduction and humanitarian assistance as the <a href=""https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/development/oecd-development-co-operation-peer-reviews-korea-2018_9789264288829-en#page40"">core motivations</a> for its development assistance. The country’s approach has been characterised by an emphasis on partner country requests and a focus on countries most in need – though inconsistently at times. Its <em><a href=""http://www.koica.go.kr/sites/koica_en/download/%EB%B6%84%EC%95%BC%EB%B3%84%EC%A4%91%EA%B8%B0%EC%A0%84%EB%9E%B5 %EC%98%81%EB%AC%B8%EB%B8%8C%EB%A1%9C%EC%85%94.pdf"">Strategic Plan for International Development Cooperation</a></em> prioritises increased development assistance to economic infrastructure and environmental policy issues, alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals, funding girls’ health and education and agricultural development.</p>
<p>The Republic of Korea’s <a href=""http://www.koica.go.kr/covid19/8017/subview.do"">response to Covid-19</a> has stressed global interconnectivity, arguing that the ‘situation highlights [the] hyper-connectivity of the globe and teaches us how important it is to take care of each other for our own safety’. The Committee for International Development Cooperation has proposed an ODA increase of KRW4.1 trillion ($3.7 billion) for 2021 to enable more funding for health and humanitarian assistance, as part of its ‘COVID-19 Response ODA Strategy’.</p>
<p>The Republic of Korea ranks 16th on the Principled Aid Index. Its ranking has stayed almost constant over the last five years. The country scores very well on global cooperation, ranking 4th on this dimension. This is driven by high spending on aid-for-trade policies, climate funding and core support for the multilateral system. The Republic of Korea has risen 12 places on this dimension since 2013, driven by an increase in spending on peace and security.</p>
<p>The Republic of Korea’s record is much worse on the public spiritedness dimension, where it ranks 20th overall. It has low scores in every indicator within this dimension, with the exception of spending in recipient countries, where it ranks third.</p>
<p>On the development gaps dimension the Republic of Korea ranks 10th, with a good performance on targeting aid towards the poorest. However, its score on this dimension is dragged down by low spending on conflict-affected states, as well as a lack of targeting of spending on social protection towards the most severely financially challenged recipients.</p>"
Luxembourg,none,none,"<p>Luxembourg’s <a href=""https://cooperation.gouvernement.lu/en/publications/strategie/strategie-generale-2030.html"">development strategy</a> states that its ‘commitment to development cooperation is driven by global solidarity and guided by its values and interests’. It considers development cooperation as a key pillar of its foreign policy, though its development programme is strongly oriented towards the poorest and most vulnerable. Its policy states that ‘the main objective of Luxembourg’s development cooperation is to contribute to the eradication of extreme poverty and the promotion of economic, social and environmental sustainability’. Luxembourg has not released an update to its development cooperation strategy in light of Covid-19.</p>
<p>Luxembourg is 5th on the Principled Aid Index, an increase of one rank since 2017. It is consistently in the top three donors in the public spiritedness dimension. This is motivated by strong scores in minimising tied aid and aid that influences elections.</p>
<p>Luxembourg is also consistently in the top ten donors on the development gaps dimension, coming 8th. This is driven by aid targeting the poorest and most severely financially challenged countries, reflecting Luxembourg’s commitment to poverty reduction.</p>
<p>Luxembourg ranks worse on the global cooperation dimension, where it has never been in the top half of donors. This is partially driven by a comparatively low share of aid dedicated to climate change mitigation and adaptation. However, its ranking in this dimension has improved, from 20th (2013) to 16th.</p>"
Netherlands,none,none,"<p>Levels of Dutch ODA have declined sharply since 2010. Its 2013 <a href=""https://www.government.nl/binaries/government/documents/letters/2013/04/05/global-dividends-a-new-agenda-for-aid-trade-and-investment/a-world-to-gain-en.pdf"">policy statement</a>, <em>A World to Gain</em>, promotes a ‘new approach’ focused on trade and investment. A new government, in office since October 2017, has committed to increasing ODA to compensate for cuts made by the previous administration. Development cooperation is set to focus on <a href=""https://donortracker.org/country/netherlands"">four objectives</a>: preventing conflict and instability; reducing poverty and social inequality; promoting sustainable and inclusive growth and climate action worldwide; and promoting the economic growth of the Netherlands. The Netherlands has not released an international development strategy response to Covid-19.</p>
<p>The Netherlands ranks 11th on the Principled Aid Index. Its strongest performance is on the global cooperation dimension, where it is 5th, coming in the top 10 donors for every indicator within this dimension.</p>
<p>The Netherlands comes 14th in the public spiritedness dimension, partially driven by aid disbursements that are unrelated to beneficiaries agreeing with the country’s position in UN votes.</p>
<p>Finally, the Netherlands ranks 16th in the development gaps dimension. It scores particularly well on aid targeting gender inequality, in line with its <a href=""https://donortracker.org/country/netherlands"">strategy in this area</a>, but it is in the bottom half of donors for all other indicators within this dimension.</p>"
New Zealand,none,none,"<p>New Zealand’s new <a href=""https://www.mfat.govt.nz/en/aid-and-development/our-approach-to-aid/"">policy for international cooperation</a> was approved in November 2019. This policy strengthens New Zealand’s focus on the Pacific region (in line with the ‘Pacific Reset’ policy), in order to target aid to ‘developing countries where New Zealand has a strategic interest’. The policy <a href=""https://www.beehive.govt.nz/speech/first-steps"">aims to reverse</a> declines in New Zealand aid: ‘development assistance helps to maintain a safer and more prosperous New Zealand over time, saving money that would otherwise be required in future defence budgets or in border control’. New Zealand has <a href=""https://www.mfat.govt.nz/en/peace-rights-and-security/covid-19-response-and-recovery/#pacific"">retained its Pacific focus</a> in its international development response to Covid-19.</p>
<p>New Zealand ranks 20th in the Principled Aid Index in 2017. Its best ranking is in the public spiritedness dimension, where it comes 5th, an increase of 19 ranks since 2017. This is driven by improvements across all five indicators. New Zealand is now ranked first on minimising the relationship between aid spending and UN voting agreement, and second on spending aid in recipient countries.</p>
<p>New Zealand ranks 27th on the development gaps dimension. The country has always been in the bottom third of donors in this dimension due to its regional focus. However, this year its score has further declined, driven by a drop in spending on gender inequality.</p>
<p>New Zealand’s ranking on the global cooperation dimension has also fallen this year, from 13th in 2017 to 18th. This is driven by a large drop in spending on peace and security. Nonetheless, New Zealand continues to be highly ranked for spending on aid-for-trade, reflecting its priorities in this area.</p>"
Norway,none,none,"<p>In 2019, Norway’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a white paper, <em>Norway’s Role and Interests in Multilateral Cooperation</em>. The paper argues that global problems require global cooperation, and that ‘it is in Norway’s interest and in line with our values to save lives and improve other people’s living conditions’. Nevertheless, Norway is grappling with how <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/10/27/why-do-nations-invest-in-international-aid-ask-norway-and-china/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.f8b1aa9d5795"">to align its aid with its narrower national interests</a>. In particular, migration control and national security have taken <a href=""http://www.realityofaid.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/9-What-next-for-the-long-standing-champion-of-high-aid-levels.pdf"">more prominent roles</a> in its development policy. Parliament has repeatedly voted to protect the integrity of Norwegian ODA and to keep its purpose firmly centred on poverty reduction and development.</p>
<p>Norway has <a href=""https://norad.no/en/front/about-norad/news/2020/this-is-how-norwegian-development-aid-funds-are-spent-2019/#:~:text=Even%20though%20Norway%20and%20several,39.4%20billion%20%E2%80%93%20without%20any%20cuts."">committed to maintaining its ODA budget</a> (in absolute terms) despite downward economic projections resulting from Covid-19. The Norwegian Minister of Development has <a href=""https://norad.no/en/front/about-norad/news/2020/this-is-how-norwegian-development-aid-funds-are-spent-"">reiterated its commitment to multilateralism</a> in the face of the pandemic. This has been accompanied by large commitments to GAVI, among other contributions to the multilateral system.</p>
<p>Norway ranks 2nd on the Principled Aid Index. Its ranking has risen slowly but consistently, from 4th place in 2013. Norway was the top-ranked donor in the global cooperation dimension. Norway has been first or second on this dimension every year since 2013. Norway ranks particularly highly on the indicator for promoting peace and security.</p>
<p>Norway also scores well on the public spiritedness dimension, coming 7th overall. However, it scores poorly on minimising tied aid, due to a large quantity of informally tied aid.</p>
<p>On the development gaps dimension, Norway receives its worst ranking, coming 14th. Norway’s record on targeting gender inequality has particularly declined, dropping five places since 2013.</p>"
Poland,none,none,"<p>Poland’s <a href=""https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/development/oecd-development-co-operation-peer-reviews-poland-2017_9789264268869-en#page20"">Development Cooperation Act</a> commits it to ‘support long-term social and economic development through actions to reduce poverty’. The country’s <a href=""https://www.polskapomoc.gov.pl/Mission,statement,204.html"">development cooperation is oriented</a> towards helping developing countries and supporting the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development; it is explicitly motivated by international solidarity. However, development cooperation is also increasingly seen as an ‘integral part’ of <a href=""https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/development/oecd-development-co-operation-peer-reviews-poland-2017_9789264268869-en#page37"">Poland’s response to geopolitical challenges</a>, including engagement in Ukraine and the Middle East. Poland has not released an international development response to Covid-19.</p>
<p>Poland ranks 26th on the Principled Aid Index. It has never ranked above the bottom third of donors. It now ranks in the bottom five donors on all three dimensions. Poland has historically ranked higher in the development gaps dimension. However, its score in both supporting displaced populations and targeting aid towards those in extreme poverty has fallen over time (12 ranks and 13 ranks since 2013, respectively), leading to an overall decline in Poland’s performance on the development gaps dimension, coming 25th on this dimension.</p>
<p>In the public spiritedness dimension Poland ranks 28th. Poland has always been in the bottom three donors on this dimension. It scores badly on all indicators within this dimension, apart from for using aid to influence elections.</p>
<p>Poland comes 24th on the global cooperation dimension. Poland has spent more on climate change mitigation and adaption, coming 12th on this indicator, a rise of 10 ranks since 2017.</p>"
Portugal,none,none,"<p>Portugal’s <em><a href=""https://www.instituto-camoes.pt/images/cooperacao/conctestratg_eng_v2.pdf"">Strategic Compact 2014–2020</a></em> sets out the main operational and thematic guidelines for the country’s development cooperation. Development is seen as a pillar of Portugal’s foreign policy and economic diplomacy that can respond to both national and international challenges. Portugal invests along two fundamental priority lines: (1) governance and the rule of law; and (2) human development and global public goods. It has a strong emphasis on the Lusaphone area, including Portuguese-speaking African countries and Timor-Leste. Portugal’s most recent <a href=""https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/development/oecd-development-co-operation-peer-reviews-portugal-2016_9789264248571-en#page35"">Development Assistance Committee peer review</a> suggested that the <em>Strategic Compact</em> signals a desire to embrace strategic partnerships based on ‘donor-partner shared responsibilities with mutual benefits’. Portugal has not released an update to its strategy in light of Covid-19.</p>
<p>Portugal ranks 21st on the Principled Aid Index. Its best rank is in the development gaps dimension, where it is 12th. It scores particularly well on targeting aid to those in extreme poverty, ranking 1st on this indicator every year for the last three years. Portugal has made significant progress on the development gaps dimension, rising 12 places since 2013. This was predominantly driven by an increase in assistance to conflict-affected states, especially Syria.</p>
<p>Portugal ranks significantly lower in the other two dimensions, coming 22nd in the global cooperation dimension and 23rd in the public spiritedness dimension. However, it scores well on minimising tied aid (part of the public spiritedness dimension), where it ranks 8th.</p>"
Slovak Republic,none,none,"<p>Slovak ODA is an instrument of the country’s foreign policy. Slovakia <a href=""https://www.slovakaid.sk/en/slovakaid"">views combating global poverty</a> as not only a moral commitment but also a tool for building a more stable, peaceful, prosperous and equitable world. <a href=""https://www.mzv.sk/web/en/foreign_policy/slovak_aid"">It argues that</a> ‘cooperation with the developing world indirectly helps Slovakia’. Its most recent international development strategy (<em><a href=""https://www.slovakaid.sk/en/publications"">Medium-Term Strategy for Development Cooperation for 2014–2018</a></em>) reflects the new requirements resulting from its accession to the Development Assistance Committee in 2013. Slovakia has not released an update to its international development strategy in light of Covid-19.</p>
<p>Slovakia is bottom of the Principled Aid Index, the first time it has ranked in last place. It places among the bottom donors on all dimensions, coming last in both the development gaps dimension and the public spiritedness dimension, and third from last in the global cooperation dimension. This marks a drop in the rankings in all three dimensions since 2017. Slovakia’s overall raw score has dropped by 4.5 points, a fall of 40% compared to 2017. The was the largest change in score of any donor since 2017. Slovakia’s performance declined on several indicators but saw a particularly large drop in targeting gender inequality.</p>"
Slovenia,none,none,"<p>Slovenia regards its <a href=""https://www.gov.si/assets/ministrstva/MZZ/Dokumenti/multilaterala/razvojno-sodelovanje/Development-Cooperation-and-Humanitarian-Aid-Strategy-of-the-Republic-of-Slovenia.pdf"">international development cooperation</a> as an important foreign policy tool in developing political and economic relations with both developing and developed countries. It aims to reduce poverty, ensure peace and security and promote sustainable development. The bulk of Slovenia’s development cooperation is <a href=""https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/development/oecd-development-co-operation-peer-reviews-slovenia-2017_9789264279308-en#page18"">concentrated in middle-income countries</a>, particularly in the Western Balkans. Slovenia’s <a href=""https://www.gov.si/assets/ministrstva/MZZ/Dokumenti/multilaterala/razvojno-sodelovanje/Development-Cooperation-and-Humanitarian-Aid-Strategy-of-the-Republic-of-Slovenia.pdf"">international development policy</a> also focuses on sub-Saharan Africa, where it views ‘ensuring prosperity for the local population and the conditions for a decent life’ as necessary for ‘addressing the root causes of migration’. Slovenia has not published an update to its international development cooperation strategy in light of Covid-19.</p>
<p>Slovenia ranks 25th in the Principled Aid Index. Its overall ranking has stayed fairly consistent over time and it has never been outside of the bottom third of donors on any of the three dimensions. Its highest rank has consistently been in the public spiritedness dimension, where it ranks 21st. This is driven by high scores in the correlation between arms exports and aid disbursements; Slovenia does not export any arms and therefore ranks 1st in this dimension in every year (jointly with Iceland). Slovenia has also made significant progress in untying aid. Slovenia has climbed 21 ranks in this indicator since 2013, rising to 6th place.</p>
<p>Slovenia is 28th on both the development gaps and global cooperation dimensions, ranking in the bottom third of donors on all indicators within these dimensions, with the exception of spending on peace and security (part of the global cooperation dimension), where it ranks 14th. Even for this indicator, this represents a comparativedecline over time, as Slovenia has fallen from 3rd place in 2015.</p>"
Spain,none,none,"<p>Spain’s policy on international cooperation for development ‘expresses the solidarity of the Spanish people with developing countries’. It is set out in a <em><a href=""http://www.exteriores.gob.es/Portal/en/PoliticaExteriorCooperacion/CooperacionAlDesarrollo/Paginas/Planificaci%C3%B3n.aspx"">Master Plan for Spanish Cooperation 2018–2021</a></em>. Published in March 2018, the plan outlines <a href=""https://donortracker.org/country/spain"">seven sectoral priorities</a> of Spanish official development assistance, all of which are linked to the Sustainable Development Goals. Spain focuses on developing new models of partnership with middle-income countries, differentiating their cooperation with these countries from that with Least Developed Countries in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>In July 2020, Spain released its <a href=""http://www.exteriores.gob.es/Portal/es/SalaDePrensa/Multimedia/Publicaciones/Documents/Estrategia_de_respuesta.pdf"">Covid-19 cooperation strategy</a>. In the strategy, Spain continues to emphasise areas with the largest development gaps, focusing on supporting the most vulnerable populations, as well as those disproportionately affected by the virus.</p>
<p>Spain ranks 22nd on the Principled Aid Index, a drop of four places, due to declining performance on all three dimensions of the Index. Spain is now in the bottom half of donors in all dimensions. Spain’s best rank continues to be in the development gaps dimension, where it comes 17th. It ranks in the bottom half in most indicators in this dimension, but compensates for this with a high score on targeting gender inequality, where it is ranked 1st.</p>
<p>In the global cooperation dimension Spain is 20th, with low scores in all indicators except for core support for the multilateral system, where it ranks 12th (although it has fallen five places on this indicator since 2017).</p>
<p>Spain ranks 24th on public spiritedness, partially driven by a poor record on spending aid in recipient countries.</p>"
Sweden,none,none,"<p>Sweden’s 2016 <a href=""https://www.government.se/49a184/contentassets/43972c7f81c34d51a82e6a7502860895/skr-60-engelsk-version_web.pdf"">policy framework on development</a> states that the country’s international development cooperation aims to ‘create preconditions for better living conditions for people living in poverty and under oppression’. Sweden’s <a href=""https://www.government.se/4940d6/contentassets/2636cd52742a4a29827b936e118a5331/strategy-for-swedens-global-development-cooperation-in-sustainable-economic-development-2018-2022.pdf"">development policy</a> focuses on development gaps, based on the Sustainable Development Goals, with a strong focus on conflict and gender equality. Sweden was the first country to implement a <a href=""https://www.government.se/information-material/2018/03/swedish-foreign-service-action-plan-for-feminist-foreign-policy-20192022-including-indicative-measures-for-2019/"">feminist foreign policy</a>. It also focuses on <a href=""https://www.government.se/articles/2017/05/new-policy-framework-for-swedish-development-cooperation-and-humanitarian-aid/"">global public goods</a>, in particular environment and climate.</p>
<p>Despite the fall in GNI in 2020, the government has <a href=""https://donortracker.org/country/sweden"">not amended the overall budget</a> for ODA for 2020, and has reiterated the importance of ensuring that its Covid-19 response does not crowd out other essential development funding. However, Swedish aid is coming under increasing <a href=""https://donortracker.org/policy-updates/controversial-report-equality-commission-proposes-reductions-swedish-oda-favor"">pressure from those wishing to redirect funding</a> towards helping Sweden recover from the effects of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Sweden ranks 3rd on the Principled Aid Index. Its score is driven by strong performance on the global cooperation dimension, where Sweden is 3rd. Sweden has been in the top 10 donors in this dimension every year. Sweden scores well across this dimension, apart from for its funding of aid-for-trade initiatives. Sweden made a particular improvement in giving core support to the multilateral system, rising seven ranks on this indicator since 2017, to put it in first place.</p>
<p>Sweden also does well on the development gaps dimension, coming 5th. This is partially driven by Sweden consistently scoring well on targeting gender inequality, coming in the top three donors on this indicator every year, and 1st in 2018.</p>
<p>By contrast, Sweden’s rank in the public spiritedness dimension has fallen by five places this year, leaving it in 13th place. This is the first time Sweden has been outside the top 10 donors on this dimension. This is driven by a drop in performance across all five indicators in this dimension.</p>"
Switzerland,none,none,"<p>In 2016, the Swiss parliament adopted the <em><a href=""https://www.eda.admin.ch/dam/eda/en/documents/publications/EntwicklungszusammenarbeitundHumanitereHilfe/Botschaft-IZA-2017-2020_EN.pdf"">Dispatch on Switzerland’s International Cooperation</a></em>, the main strategy guiding Swiss aid activities for 2017–2020. The Dispatch promotes international development ‘in the interests of Switzerland’. The strategy sits alongside the Swiss <a href=""https://www.eda.admin.ch/dam/eda/en/documents/publications/SchweizerischeAussenpolitik/Aussenpolitische-Strategie_EN.pdf"">foreign policy statement for 2016–2019</a>, which seeks to contribute development resources towards the Sustainable Development Goals. Following the release of the <em>Dispatch</em>, the government launched a large-scale austerity programme that disproportionately <a href=""http://www.realityofaid.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/5-Decreasing-ODA-funds-increasingly-spent-on-migration-and-public-private-partnerships.pdf"">cut the development cooperation budget</a>. There was also considerable debate about making explicit the link between the provision of ODA and partner countries’ agreement to accept rejected asylum-seekers. While the measure was narrowly defeated in parliament, a softer variant that links development cooperation and migration policy did pass.</p>
<p>Switzerland’s <a href=""https://reliefweb.int/report/world/covid-19-switzerland-strengthens-international-cooperation"">response to Covid-19</a> has focused on getting assistance to developing countries as quickly as possible, as well as supporting international responses.</p>
<p>Switzerland ranks 6th on the Principled Aid Index. Its highest position is consistently in the public spiritedness dimension, where it is 3rd. It has never ranked outside the top 10 donors on this dimension. This is driven by strong scores on all indicators within this dimension.</p>
<p>Switzerland ranks 12th on the global cooperation dimension. It scores particularly well on providing core funding for the multilateral system and spending on global peace and security. However, Switzerland’s spending on the latter has fallen relatively over time, and it has dropped from 1st place (2013) to 7th.</p>
<p>Finally, Switzerland ranks 13th on the development gaps dimension. It scores well on targeting spending on social safety nets towards the most severely financially challenged recipients.

United Kingdom,none,none,"<p>In June 2020, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the merger of the Department for International Development and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, as the government seeks to promote <a href=""https://donortracker.org/country/united-kingdom"">greater alignment</a> between the UK’s development assistance and foreign policy objectives. In absolute terms, the <a href=""https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/uk-recession-bank-of-england-warning-coronavirus-economy-2020-gdp-forecast-a9503006.html"">UK’s aid budget will fall</a> by up to 15% in 2020. This has led the UK to <a href=""https://www.devex.com/news/exclusive-dfid-pauses-some-new-decisions-as-aid-budget-expected-to-fall-97416"">pause funding on new projects</a>, and shift funding on current projects towards the Covid-19 response.</p>
<p>The UK ranks 10th on the Principled Aid Index, a slight improvement after declining since 2013. The UK scores well on the development gaps dimension, coming 7th overall. This is driven by strong scores in supporting displaced populations and assisting conflict-affected states.</p>
<p>It also does well on global cooperation, scoring highly on all indicators in this dimension, except for spending on climate adaptation and mitigation. It performs particularly well on providing core support for the multilateral system, where it is ranked 2nd.</p>
<p>The UK’s overall ranking is brought down by a poor score on the public spiritedness dimension, where it is 19th. The UK has consistently ranked in the bottom half of donors on this dimension, compared to consistently being in the top 10 on the other two dimensions. The UK’s rank on the public spiritedness dimension is particularly driven by its poor record on associations between aid and arms exports. The UK took second-to-last place on this indicator between 2013 and 2017, but it has now dropped to last place.</p>"

United States,none,none,"<p>The current development assistance strategic framework for the US Department of State and the United States Agency for International Development is laid out in the 2018–2022 <em><a href=""https://donortracker.org/country/united-states"">Joint Strategic Plan</a></em>. There are four overarching goals: (1) protect America’s security at home and abroad;(2) renew America’s competitive advantage for sustained economic growth and job creation; (3) promote American leadership through balanced engagement; and (4) ensure effectiveness and accountability to the American taxpayer. An <a href=""http://www.realityofaid.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/11-The-challenges-and-opportunities-of-US-Foreign-Assistance-under-Trump.pdf"">‘America-first’ strategy</a> has significantly reduced the country’s commitment to multilateralism, including reduced funding for the United Nations and threats to stop aid to countries voting against the US.</p>
<p>In response to Covid-19, the US has passed <a href=""https://donortracker.org/country/united-states"">two bills to increase ODA</a> to affected countries, but at the same time has <a href=""https://www.devex.com/news/disrupt-and-compete-how-trump-changed-us-foreign-aid-97955"">cut funding to the WHO</a> over politically motivated concerns.</p>
<p>The US ranks 13th on the Principled Aid Index, a fall of five places since 2017, the largest drop of any donor. The US takes its lowest-ever ranking on all three dimensions. Nonetheless, it continues to rank highly on the development gaps dimension, coming 4th overall (compared to either 2nd or 3rd in previous years). This is driven by a strong performance in targeting aid towards the poorest, and assisting conflict-affected states. However, the US has seen a large fall in its ranking on targeting gender inequality, dropping 11 places on this indicator since 2017.</p>
<p>The US has a mixed record on the global cooperation dimension, coming 11th overall. It consistently scores well in reducing the spread of communicable diseases, coming top on this ranking for the sixth year running. It also scores highly on spending on climate change mitigation and adaption, as well as spending on peace and security. By contrast, the US is consistently in the bottom third of donors for spending on global trade and core support for the multilateral system.</p>
<p>On the public spiritedness dimension, the US is ranked 18th. This is driven by a particularly poor score on the indicator for tied aid. While most donors have reduced their level of tied aid, the US has not, leaving it in 27th place on this indicator. The US also scores badly on linking aid to UN votes, coming 22nd on this indicator, suggesting that threats to stop aid to countries voting against the US may have been carried through. In all years, the US’s worst performance has been on the public spiritedness dimension, which aligns with its continued use of aid to support strategic allies.</p>"
